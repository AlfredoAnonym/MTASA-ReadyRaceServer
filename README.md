# MTASA-ReadyRaceServer
A ready race server repository. Contains various scripts that racing servers use and some new scripts too. Ready for casual racing or pro racing.

Will contain most important scripts, like Pole Remover (it will not work from the start of the server, don't worry) Offroad Wheels and much more. There will be also a classic clanwar script by Vally, redesigned and remixed.

Map Uploader script info:

It fetches one file (for now) from this repository: https://github.com/AlfredoAnonym/MTASA-Race-Server so if you don't have "30 Fps Cap" script that will allow you to turn on 30 fps in your map that you'll upload, you don't need to have it. It's fetched by the fetchRemote function inside the script ;)

I have a server that I launch frequently (not 24/h server) if you'll see me - you can jump in and we can play mtasa://51.75.58.35:10899

Changes for some classic scripts

Map Ratings - Now correctly working, with its own F4 gui where you can sort best rated / worst rated maps
VallyCW - Race League (clanwar) script by Vally. Completely overhauled, added bunch of new things - including ability to set captains, new point system more used in FFA games, /tech pause (it locks after 10 seconds) and much more
cw_script - Edited by BurN, now edited by Mateoryt. Also added new points system, and overhauled the script with new features.
Toptimes - Retained more classic look, but edited few things like colors (1st, 2nd, 3rd toptimes), similar to SiK server back in the day. Only bad thing about it is spacing between the country flag. I'll probably upload robson race_toptimes here too, but if country flags will not work there for you, then use this one or remix the Robson script. It uses the flags from the scoreboard resource
Carhide - the classic carhide from servers like GTA.RU back in the day. Fixed and working on newer servers
Delay Indicator - smaller delay indicator, with an new command /clearsplits to clear splits when you delete a toptime. They will not show up anymore if you do that :)
