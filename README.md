# MTASA-ReadyRaceServer
A ready race server repository. Contains various scripts that racing servers use and some new scripts too. Ready for casual racing or pro racing.

Will contain most important scripts, like Pole Remover (it will not work from the start of the server, don't worry) Offroad Wheels and much more. There will be also a classic clanwar script by Vally, redesigned and remixed.

Map Uploader script info:

It fetches one file (for now) from this repository: https://github.com/AlfredoAnonym/MTASA-Race-Server so if you don't have "30 Fps Cap" script that will allow you to turn on 30 fps in your map that you'll upload, you don't need to have it. It's fetched by the fetchRemote function inside the script ;)

I have a server that I launch frequently (not 24/h server) if you'll see me - you can jump in and we can play mtasa://51.75.58.35:10899
