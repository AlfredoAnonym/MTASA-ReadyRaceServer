# MTASA-ReadyRaceServer
A ready race server repository. Contains various scripts that racing servers use and some new scripts too. Ready for casual racing or pro racing.

Will contain most important scripts, like Pole Remover (it will not work from the start of the server, don't worry) Offroad Wheels and much more. There will be also a classic clanwar script by Vally, redesigned and remixed.
